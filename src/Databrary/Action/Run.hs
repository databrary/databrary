-- How to run Databrary Actions.
--
-- This module is the foundation of the site. It provides a method for packaging
-- up route actions into 'Wai.Application's (which is effectively the HTTP
-- transport layer), as well as a method for packaging them into background
-- threads.

-- Transform a web request to a lower-level action.

-- Given an action that runs in a top-level Handler, build the necessary context
-- for that action, and run in it in the base-level ActionContextM
--
-- Handler has a richer context: it has all of ActionContext, plus Identity and
-- the Wai Request.

-- | Authentication requirements for an 'Action'.
data NeedsAuthentication = NeedsAuthentication | DoesntNeedAuthentication

-- | This type captures both the authentication needs and the handler for a
-- route.
--
-- It extends ActionRoute, which already has most info about a route and how to
-- serve it, to include the authentication requirement.

-- | Convert an Action into a Wai.Application.
--
-- This is the 3rd level of the Databrary \"web framework\". It runs the
-- requested action with some resolved identity to build the HTTP response. See
-- 'actionRouteApp' for level 2, and 'servantApp' for level 1.
--
-- TODO: For converting to Servant, this whole function should be duplicated by
-- new combinators.
--
-- For instance, there is a section (in the second 'let', within the do) where
-- headers are added to the response. Servant requires us to put that in the
-- type, which can be easily done. We can even make a combinator for looking up
-- auth results and logging access. After all that, we should be able to create
-- something with HoistServer that will run the rest of the (Databrary) Handler.
--
-- But then we'll have to map the Response (Action ~ ReaderT RequestContext IO
-- Response) into something else! And how do we catch exceptions? Plain old
-- catch blocks? And what do we convert exceptions into?
