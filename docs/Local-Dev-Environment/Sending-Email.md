### Sign-Up | Log-In | Email Confirmation

    In order Sign up for Databrary within your test environment, you will need to
    be able to receive the confirmation email.

    Emails have been configured to redirect to https://mailtrap.io/ (MailTrap), an
    email test environment. Here you can be invited to the shared email trap, or
    you can create and use your own credentials.

    To add/modify email credentials of your Databrary developer environment, edit
    the config/email document found in the root of the project directory.

    Once you have confirmed your account will need to be approved by an
    administrative user. There are two predefined administrative accounts:

      1. admin@databrary.org
      2. test@databrary.org

    Passwords for these accounts are given to qualified developers upon request.
